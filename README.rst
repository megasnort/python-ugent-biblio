============
UGent Biblio
============

`Ghent University Academic Bibliography`_ contains all the scientific publications by UGent_ Researchers. The API_ is public and pretty straight forward.

To use the API in Python this wrapper is available. Instead of returning JSON, it returns dictionaries, and provides methods for querying the API, instead of having to do the formatting yourself.

Installation
------------

Since we are still very beta:

::

    pip install git+git://github.com/megasnort/python-ugent-biblio.git
